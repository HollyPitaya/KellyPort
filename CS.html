        <p> My interest in computer science started in elementary school, when I did basic block coding. Middle school 
            only fueled this interest, were I took every computer science class the school had to offer. Middle school 
            also allowed me to explore engineering in a few classes which immediately sparked my interest. Now, in high 
            school, I plan to further my knowledge by taking advanced classes and competing in competitions.

    <p> Currently I am taking a CS projects class. In this class I work with my fellow classmates using the 
        <a style="color: #110234;" href="https://www.scrum.org/">Scrum</a> principles to code projects. 
        Projects of this class that I am working on or have been completed are in the projects tab.

        <p> In my sophomore year of high school, I took a Cybersecurity class at my district's tech school. 
            This class covered laws and ethics, hardware and software, and networking.

        <p>I am also apart of <a style="color: #110234;"href="https://www.uscyberpatriot.org/">CyberPatriots</a>, were 
            I mainly work with Windows Server and Windows 10. Our team (16-0377) was new this year, but despite this 
            we were able to make it to the State Rounds at platinum rank - the highest possible rank a team can achieve.

            <h2 style="font-size: 49px;">AP Computer Science A</h2> 
        <p> For my Freshman year of High School, I audited an AP Computer Science A class. This class was based off of 
            computer science A course in <a style="color: #110234;" href="https://code.org">Code.org</a> and delt with 
            the JAVA programing language. At the end of the class I took the AP test and received a score of 5. 
            Kelly Uno was my final project in this class. (See projects tab).
