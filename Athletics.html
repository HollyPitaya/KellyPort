        <h2>Taekwondo</h2>
        <p> I joined Taekwondo in 2016 when I was in elementary school. What drew me to martial arts was the fact that I just thought it was really cool,
             and this mindset benefited me. It taught me discipline and helped me keep healthy.
        </p>
        <p>
            I received my first degree black belt in Taekwondo on November 7th, 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am no longer taking Taekwondo classes as Taekwondo was quite time consuming and I wanted to focus more on my education.

        <h2>Krav Maga</h2>
        <p > In the summer of 2022, I signed up for a Krav Maga class at Colorado Krav Maga, and instantly loved it. 
            Krav Maga is a martial arts that is all about defending yourself from street attacks/fights.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am currently an orange belt in Krav Maga and hope to improve my fighting skills even more!

        <h2>Weight Lifting</h2>
        <p > I first got into weights during physical therapy after suffering an injury. So, in my sophomore year of 
            high school, I took Weight Training 1. After the class I continue to work on improving my strength through 
            weightlifting.
