        <p>"William and Jennie Klinger Pinewood Minnesota." In different handwriting: "Aunt Millie"
        </p>
        <p>Left is Jennie and right is William. This was a marriage photograph taken in 1930. 
            It can be inferred that the "Aunt Millie" writing is referring to Jennie. Jennie and William once 
            lived together on a farm in Minnesota. William was reported to live to be over 100 years old.
        </p>
        <p>Jennie's mother was named Mary Johnson Burgeson.
