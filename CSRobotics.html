        <p>I joined my high school's robotics club freshmen year: Lighting Robotics. Currently, as a sophomore, I am the 
            logistics manager of the club as well as being one of the general engineers. My job as the logistics manager 
            includes getting funding, keeping our social media pages active, and maintain our website. As an engineer, I 
            work on the construction and building of robots as well as the building of competition pieces. 
        </p>
        <p> Every year we build a new robot for the FIRST Robotics Competition. We are FRC team #5763. And if we are not 
            able to go to the competition, we still work by improving old robots and upgrading our equipment!
